# WebPod

## What Is it?
WebPod is a web app designed to resemble the design and functionality of an Apple iPod. The project is preloaded with predefined data stored as JSON. The data is used to load the iPod with songs. The iPod will not play audio, but otherwise works as normal. 

## Continuing Work
I do not plan on expanding the functionality of this application to actually play music, since an application like this already exists on github that does this well. I started this project to show knowledge of Vue and as a design challenge.

## Technologies used
This project used Vue (v3) as the framework and Pinia, for state management.
